* Changes in 0.2 (since 0.1.3)

** Daemon outputs returned value to FIFO file

Previously, Guile Daemon only received commands from fifo file.  Now, it
also outputs the result of evaluation back to the fifo file.  "gdpipe"
shell script waits for the evaluation and prints the result to sdtout.

Not sure if using a single fifo file in both direction is a good idea,
though.  Both, guile-daemon and gdpipe, are reading and writing to the
same fifo file (on their turns).  This works good so far.  However, if a
user will send a code to the fifo file directly (without gdpipe) and
will not read the output, then guile-daemon itself will read its own
output and will try to evaluate it.  So using 2 different fifo files
would probably be a better solution.

* Changes in 0.1.3 (since 0.1.2)

** Default runtime directory is changed

Previously, fifo and socket files were placed in
"~/.config/guile-daemon/run".  Now the default directory is
"$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/guile-daemon".

** Support for Guile 3.0 added

* Changes in 0.1.2 (since 0.1.1)

** Texinfo manual added

* Changes in 0.1.1 (since 0.1)

** Support for Guile 2.2 added

** Current locale is installed

I.e., now the following displays the proper text:

  gdpipe '(display "привет") (newline)'

Previously it displayed "??????".

** Remove unsuitable FIFO file on start-up

Previously when FIFO file existed, but was unsuitable (wrong
permissions, etc.), guile-daemon failed to start.
